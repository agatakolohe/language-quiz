# Programming Language Suggester

#### JavaScript & jQuery Independent Project for Epicodus, 10-23-2020

#### By Agata Kolodziej

## Description

Second independent project for Epicodus. It is a quiz for people interested in learning a programming language. It will suggest a language the user should learn first based upon their answers to the questions. This project demonstrates what I have learned in JavaScript and jQuery so far. I created a form that will take user input and show a language suggestion based on the answers they submitted. There is a link at the bottom of the result to take the user to a page that has all the language results and more information about each one. I used Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for functionality.
