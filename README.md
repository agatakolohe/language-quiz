# Programming Language Suggester

#### JavaScript & jQuery Independent Project for Epicodus Intro to Programming, 09-24-2020

#### By Agata Kolodziej

## Description

Second independent project for Epicodus Intro to Programming. It is a quiz for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. It demonstrates what I have learned in JS and jQuery so far. I created a form that will ask questions about the users preferences and provide a language suggestion based on their answers. There is a link at the bottom of the result to take the user to a page that has all the results to the languages and their descriptions. I used Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for functionality.
