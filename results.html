            <h5 class="card-title">Ruby</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Ruby is mostly used for building web applications. It is a general-purpose language, so it has many other appplications such as data analysis, prototyping, and proof of concepts. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Mastumoto in Japan. Ruby is often confused with Ruby on Rails, which is a server-side framework written in Ruby under the MIT License for implementing web applications. It is a <strong>back-end language</strong>. Big companies using Ruby include: GitHub, Airbnb and Groupon. To learn more <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Click Here</a></p>

            <h5 class="card-title">C#</h5>
            <p class="card-text">C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. It is good for developing games. C#, pronounced as "C sharp", was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .NET initiative and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation where sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++. It is a <strong>back-end language</strong>. Big companies using C# include: Microsoft and Apple. It is widely used to create games using the Unity game engine, which is the most popular game engine today.

            <h5 class="card-title">JavaScript</h5>
            <p class="card-text">JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for web pages, but it is used in many non-browser enviornments as well. JavaScript (JS) was developed in 1995 by Netscape programmer Brandan Eich in just <strong>10 days</strong>. It was originally named <em>Mocha</em>. Along with HTML and CSS it is one of the three main parts of the World Wide Web. It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. <strong>It is distinctly different from Java</strong>. It is a <strong>front-end language</strong>. Big companies using JS include: Netflix, PayPal and Uber. To learn more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript">Click Here</a></p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Python</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. It is one of the most popular programming languages nowadays on account of its code readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido Van Rossum. He named it Python after his the comedy troupe <em>Monty Python</em>. Python can be used for either <strong>front-end or back-end</strong> development. It's approachable syntax and widespread server-side use makes it a core programming language for <strong>back-end</strong> development. Big companies using Python include: NASA, Google, and Facebook.

            <p class="card-text">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web with HTML as its publishing language. It is a good starter language if you are new to programming. To learn more <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">Click Here</a></p>

            <p class="card-text">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JS. CSS is designed to enable the seperation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. It was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie in 1994, who, at the time, was working with Tim Berners-Lee.
